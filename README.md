Task_1: I am creating a error handling program. This program handle error in the program

Example: Let's i am creating a sample.txt file but, i accidentaly put the wrong name in the open file of python, than it will stop working without handlin the error, So i am going to use error handling concept here to deal with error and run the code easily without getting stuck in between.

Task_2: I am creating a file which can accept values from the user and append in the output.txt file and print the all added text in the file.
